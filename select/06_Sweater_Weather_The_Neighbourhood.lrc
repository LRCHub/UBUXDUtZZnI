[00:06.68] And all I am is a man
[00:10.33] I want the world in my hands
[00:14.16] I hate the beach but I stand
[00:18.20] In California with my toes in the sand
[00:21.97] Use the sleeves of my sweater
[00:23.98] Let's have an adventure
[00:26.01] Head in the clouds but my gravity's centered
[00:30.07] Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
[00:33.70] You in those little high-waisted shorts, oh
[00:39.05] She knows what I think about
[00:41.24] And what I think about
[00:42.95] One love, two mouths
[00:44.97] One love, one house
[00:46.77] No shirt, no blouse
[00:48.64] Just us, you find out
[00:50.27] Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no
[00:53.17] 'Cause it's too cold
[00:57.18] For you here and now
[01:00.73] So let me hold
[01:04.83] Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
[01:09.48] And if I may just take your breath away
[01:11.76] I don't mind if there's not much to say
[01:13.82] Sometimes the silence guides our minds
[01:15.47] So move to a place so far away
[01:17.82] The goosebumps start to raise
[01:19.47] The minute that my left hand meets your waist
[01:22.00] And then I watch your face
[01:23.07] Put my finger on your tongue
[01:24.13] 'Cause you love to taste, yeah
[01:25.96] These hearts adore
[01:27.06] Everyone the other beats hardest for
[01:29.41] Inside this place is warm
[01:31.39] Outside it starts to pour
[01:33.93] Coming down
[01:35.12] One love, two mouths
[01:37.17] One love, one house
[01:38.92] No shirt, no blouse
[01:40.83] Just us, you find out
[01:42.54] Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no, no, no
[01:47.33] 'Cause it's too cold
[01:51.49] For you here and now
[01:54.99] So let me hold
[01:59.19] Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
[02:03.06] 'Cause it's too cold
[02:06.76] For you here and now
[02:10.53] So let me hold
[02:14.54] Both your hands in the holes of my sweater, whoa
[02:38.54] 
[02:31.74] Whoa, whoa, whoa
[02:39.42] Whoa, whoa, whoa
[02:46.87] Whoa, whoa
[02:51.87] 
[02:55.28] Whoa, whoa, whoa
[03:02.90] Whoa, whoa
[03:08.64] 'Cause it's too cold
[03:12.50] For you here and now
[03:16.27] So let me hold
[03:20.16] Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
[03:24.57] It's too cold
[03:28.07] For you here and now
[03:32.13] Let me hold
[03:35.80] Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
[03:41.23] And it's too cold
[03:43.60] It's too cold
[03:46.12] The holes of my sweater
