All I am is a man
I want the world in my hands
I hate the beach
But I stand
In California
With my toes in the sand
Use the sleeves of my sweater
Let's have an adventure
Head in the clouds
But my gravity's centered
Touch my neck
And I'll touch yours
In my little high-waisted
Shorts, oh
You knows what I think about
And what I think about
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna
Tell you about, no
Cause it's too cold
For you here and now
So let me hold
Both your hands
In the holes of my sweater
And if I may just
Take your breath away
I don't mind if there's
Not much to say
Sometimes the silence
Guides our minds
So move to a place so far away
The goose bumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand
Meets your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue
Cause you love to taste, yeah
These hearts adore
Everyone the other
Beats hardest for
Inside this place is warm
Outside it starts to pour
Coming down
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna
Tell you about, no, no, no
Cause it's too cold
For you here and now
So let me hold
Both your hands
In the holes of my sweater
Cause it's too cold
For you here and now
So let me hold
Both your hands
In the holes of my sweater
Cause it's too cold
For you here and now
So let me hold
Both your hands
In the holes of my sweater
Cause it's too cold
For you here and now
So let me hold
Both your hands
In the holes of my sweater
It's too cold
It's too cold
In the holes of my sweater
