Oh, Hannah, I wanna feel you close
Oh, Hannah, come lie with my bones
Oh, Hannah, don't look away
Oh, Hannah, just look at me the same

I don't wanna be your friend, I wanna kiss your lips
I wanna kiss you until I lose my breath
I don't wanna be your friend, I wanna kiss your lips
I wanna kiss you until I lose my breath

Oh, Hannah, tell me something nice
Like flowers and blue skies
Oh, Hannah, I will follow you home
Although my lips are blue and I'm cold

I don't wanna be your friend, I wanna kiss your lips
I wanna kiss you until I lose my breath
I don't wanna be your friend, I wanna kiss your lips
I wanna kiss you until I lose my breath

I don't wanna be your friend, I wanna be your bitch

Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah

'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
Cold for you, here
Now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
